# AOS-100
AOS-100 (Alcohol Operation Seto-100 model) is a machine learning model which predicts intellectual productivity of Seto (myself) by the amount of alcohol I drunk. 
AOS-100 predicts by the amount of pure alcohol(g), temperture(C), and humidity(%).

Use the code written below for a prediction.

predictions = model.predict([[50, 26, 65])

This code predicts Seto's productivity when 50g of alcohol was drunk in a 26 degree celsius, 65% humidity environment.

Please use this model for scientific research, experiments, or for fun.
